### Fixed Bugs

- The assignCharacter function didn't work properly. The problem was in setting the background-image url and inserting it as a new style for the element. When looking through some tutorials (W3Schools, Stackoverflow), I have realised that I have set it wrong. I changed it to "url(" + chosenCharacter + ")", then I updated url in the object to "url('./assets/images/grey.webp')", so I can use a variable instead of concatenating and it worked perfectly this way.
